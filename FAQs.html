  <div class="box content"><h2>Why is a cybernetic insect a good idea as opposed to attempting to develop an insect-size flying robot?</h2>

<h3>Common dragonflies weigh around 600 milligrams, can reach accelerations up to 9 gs, and are known to migrate over great distances. Mechanical fliers of comparable size are far less efficient at producing lift, stabilizing flight, and storing energy. This inefficiency creates a fundamental challenge: Mechanical fliers can carry only very small power sources, which means that they have enough power to fly for only very brief periods of time. The DragonflEye system doesn’t require a power source for flight, only for navigation. It can operate indefinitely due to the insect’s ability to replenish energy from food and the navigation system’s ability to harvest energy from the environment.</h3>
  <br> <h2>Can you describe the components and capabilities of the backpack guidance system in more detail, and why did you decide to mount it on a dragonfly specifically?</h2>

<h3>The backpack is designed to navigate autonomously, harvest solar energy for extended operation, deliver light pulses through optrodes to control steering neurons, and wirelessly transmit data to an external base station. This is our first-generation system, which will allow us to develop insect guidance using optogenetic stimulation. Next steps will further reduce the size and weight of the DragonflEye system by developing a custom integrated system-on-chip. Further miniaturization will reduce the payload burden and allow the system to be worn by even smaller insects. 

Dragonflies are interesting because they are found worldwide and are very robust and agile fliers for their small size. Future work could extend guidance to other insects, including important pollinators.</h3>
  <br>   <br><h2>How do optrodes work, and what are the advantages of using them to interface with neurons?</h2>

<h3> Much like an electrode, which creates an electrical interface with neurons, an optrode creates an optical interface, allowing light to be either delivered to neurons for stimulation or be captured from light-emitting neurons for monitoring activity. While neurons in the retina are naturally activated by light, which allows you to see, neurons in the rest of the body are not naturally sensitive to light. By inserting genetic material that encodes special light-sensitive proteins, called opsins, neurons can be modified to be activated, or even inhibited, by different colors of light.

In addition, genetic material can be inserted that causes neurons to emit light when they are active. These new optogenetic tools allow optrodes to both monitor and stimulate neurons with far greater specificity than can be achieved by electrodes. A reason for this improved specificity is that electrical fields interact with all neurons in proximity to the electrode, but light will only interact with neurons that have been genetically modified. Additionally, while electric fields are good at activating neurons, it is more difficult to inhibit them. In contrast, different types of opsins can be used to both activate and inhibit neurons simply by changing the color of light passed through the optrode.</h3>
