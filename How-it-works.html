  <div class="box sidebar"><h3>Research at HHMI—led by Anthony Leonardo, Janelia Research Campus group leader—has led to a deeper understanding of “steering” neurons in the nervous system of the dragonfly that control flight. HHMI is applying techniques in synthetic biology to make these “steering” neurons sensitive to light by inserting genes similar to those naturally found in the eye.  

Draper is developing tiny optical structures, called optrodes, that can activate the special “steering” neurons with pulses of light piped into the nerve cord from the dragonfly’s backpack. Traditional optical fibers are too stiff to be wrapped around the tiny dragonfly nerve cord, so Draper developed innovative flexible optrodes that can bend light around sub-millimeter turns.  These optrodes will enable precise and targeted neural activation without disrupting the thousands of nearby neurons.

  <div class="box content"><h3>The backpack itself is designed for autonomous navigation, which is a departure from past systems that required wireless control from an operator.  In addition, the backpack contains solar panels that allow it to harvest energy from the environment for extended operation, as well as the ability to wirelessly transmit various types of data back to a base station.  The DragonflEye system only requires power for navigation and data transfer, not flight.  This means it can operate indefinitely and has a decided advantage over robotic insects and previous systems, which had very limited flight time.  As second-generation backpack is already in development and will be smaller, light, and more functional.</h3>
